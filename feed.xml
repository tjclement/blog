Their flagship high-CRI temperature adjustable NL660-2.4 panels1 are around half the price of an Elgato Key Light, and come with a wireless remote to control them. I recently picked up a pair of them, and Iâ€™m very happy with their light quality an... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Playing audio from Amazon Echo to a Raspberry Pi over Bluetooth</title><link href="https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/playing-audio-from-amazon-echo-to-a-raspberry-pi-over-bluetooth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Playing audio from Amazon Echo to a Raspberry Pi over Bluetooth" /><published>2017-06-27T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2017-06-27T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/playing-audio-from-amazon-echo-to-a-raspberry-pi-over-bluetooth/</id> <content src="https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/playing-audio-from-amazon-echo-to-a-raspberry-pi-over-bluetooth/" /> <author> <name>Tom Clement</name> </author> <category term="blog" /> <summary> Our homeâ€™s tech arsenal was recently expanded by an Amazon Echo Dot, the affordable baby brother of the older Echo. Even though they are not officially available in The Netherlands, luckily there is a nifty way of setting it up regardless if you manage to get your hands on one. (UPDATE: you can now get one in NL too!) The Dot has a normal 3.5mm aux headphone jack to connect it to speakers, but... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Messing About With The Hi-Link RM04</title><link href="https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/messing-about-with-the-hi-link-rm04/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Messing About With The Hi-Link RM04" /><published>2014-03-24T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2014-03-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/messing-about-with-the-hi-link-rm04/</id> <content src="https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/messing-about-with-the-hi-link-rm04/" /> <author> <name>Tom Clement</name> </author> <category term="blog" /> <summary> This blog posting has been on my personal backlog of over half a year now, and Iâ€™m very excited to be able to finally have had a moment to catch my breath and finish it. Enjoy! For a home automation project, I recently bought a few bluetooth and wifi modules to hook up to an Arduino or Rasp Pi. I was most interested in one particular board: the Hi-Link RM04 Wifi to Serial module.

Itâ€™s not just the product they deliver, but the enormously vast positive impact they have made on the world of open source. They helped people love to share, help each other out, and build amazing things together. Itâ€™s an entire culture of contributers and excited innovators, itâ€™s a great (virtual) place to be. Like any explosively growing co... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Effectively Leveraging Scalable Cloud Infrastructure</title><link href="https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/effectively-leveraging-scalable-cloud-infrastructure/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Effectively Leveraging Scalable Cloud Infrastructure" /><published>2013-09-02T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2013-09-02T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/effectively-leveraging-scalable-cloud-infrastructure/</id> <content src="https://www.inthenameofscience.nl/effectively-leveraging-scalable-cloud-infrastructure/" /> <author> <name>Tom Clement</name> </author> <category term="blog" /> <summary> Ever since cloud computing was made widely accessible by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine, a large amount of companies has taken advantage of the flexibility and scalability that the cloud offers. However great it may seem though, virtual hardware doesnâ€™t always work for everyone. When consistency in traffic is reached at a considerably high amount of visitors, b... </summary> </entry> </feed>
