As most developers, I too am a great fan of GitHub. It’s not just the product they deliver, but the enormously vast positive impact they have made on the world of open source. They helped people love to share, help each other out, and build amazing things together. It’s an entire culture of contributers and excited innovators, it’s a great (virtual) place to be.

Like any explosively growing company, GitHub too has struggled to keep their infrastructure and software in pace with the swiftly increasing user base. Looking at some of their PassionProject videos (which are [really cool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZqXc1E91mE)), I stumbled upon this youtube video in which [Vicent Martí](https://twitter.com/vmg) explains a bit about how GitHub started out, and how they chose to work on their approaches in order to scale better:
